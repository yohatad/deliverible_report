%% Please be warned that this is NOT a full-featured framework for
%% creating (all sorts of) questionnaires. Rather, it is a small
%% collection of LaTeX commands that I found useful when creating a
%% questionnaire. Feel free to copy and adjust any parts you like.
%% Most probably, you will want to change the commands, so that they
%% fit your taste.
%%
%% Also note that I am not a LaTeX expert! Things can very likely be
%% done much more elegant than I was able to. If you have suggestions
%% about what can be improved please send me an email. I intend to
%% add good tipps to my website and to name contributers of course.
%%
%% 10/2012: Thanks to karathan for the suggestion to put \noindent
%% before \rule!

%% \Qq = Questionaire question. Oh, this is just too simple. It helps
%% making it easy to globally change the appearance of questions.
%\newcommand{\Qq}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
\newcommand{\Qq}[1]{{#1}} %DV

%% \QO = Circle or box to be ticked. Used both by direct call and by \Qrating and \Qlist.
\newcommand{\QO}{$\Box$}% or: $\ocircle$

%% \Qrating = Automatically create a rating scale with NUM steps, like this: 0--0--0--0--0.
\newcounter{qr}
\newcommand{\Qrating}[1]{\QO\forloop{qr}{1}{\value{qr} < #1}{---\QO}}

%% \Qline = Again, this is very simple. It helps setting the line
%% thickness globally. Used both by direct call and by \Qlines.
\newcommand{\Qline}[1]{\noindent\rule{#1}{0.6pt}}

%% \Qlines = Insert NUM lines with width=\linewith. You can change the \vskip value to adjust the spacing.
\newcounter{ql}
\newcommand{\Qlines}[1]{\forloop{ql}{0}{\value{ql}<#1}{\vskip0em\Qline{\linewidth}}}

%% \Qlist = This is an environment very similar to itemize but with
%% \QO in front of each list item. Useful for classical multiple
%% choice. Change leftmargin and topsep according to your taste.
\newenvironment{Qlist}{%
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\QO}
%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,topsep=-.5em]}{
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,topsep=0em]}{
\end{itemize}

%% \Qtab = A "tabulator simulation". The first argument is the
%% distance from the left margin. The second argument is content which

\newlength{\qt}
\newcommand{\Qtab}[2]{
\setlength{\qt}{\linewidth}
\addtolength{\qt}{-#1}
\hfill\parbox[t]{\qt}{\raggedright #2}

%% \Qitem = Item with automatic numbering. The first optional argument
%% can be used to create sub-items like 2a, 2b, 2c, ... The item
%% number is increased if the first argument is omitted or equals 'a'.
%% You will have to adjust this if you prefer a different numbering
%% scheme. Adjust topsep and leftmargin as needed.
\newcounter{itemnummer}
\newcommand{\Qitem}[2][]{% #1 optional, #2 notwendig

\section*{Executive Summary}
%===============================================================
\label{executive_summary}
%%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}
 
Deliverable D1.2  comprises a catalogue of general, population-based cultural knowledge in the form of behaviors, activities, actions, and movements that are either culturally sensitive or culturally insensitive. This knowledge will be used to specify the culturally sensitive African modes of social interaction in Deliverable D1.3 and the Africa-centric design patterns in Deliverable D1.4. It will be formalized in the culture knowledge ontology and knowledge base in Deliverable D5.4.1.  The cultural knowledge will be gathered by developing a detailed questionnaire and using it  to interview a cross-section of Rwandan citizens in November and December 2023.
{\bf This first draft of the deliverable just addresses the survey questionnaire, so that it can be validated before conducting the survey.}

\section{Introduction}
%===============================================================
 
This report will be a compilation of the culture-specific knowledge that is needed to achieve culturally-competent human robot interaction between robots and Rwandan people.   The knowledge focusses on human-human interaction, rather than human-robot interaction. Appropriate elements of this knowledge will then be used in Tasks 1.3 and 1.4 to specify culturally sensitive modes of robot behavior for human-robot interaction. This approach was adopted to avoid introducing the concept of social robots, something that may not be familiar to all participants in the survey,  when canvassing their views.   It is planned to conduct this canvassing exercise using the questionnaire in Appendix I. {\bf  This first draft of the deliverable focusses on the survey questionnaire, so that it can be validated prior to conducting the survey.}
 
\section{Rwandan Cultural Knowledge for Respectful Interaction}
%===============================================================
 
The knowledge will be structured according to an ontology of cultural knowledge for respectful interaction detailed in Appendix II.  This ontology is a preemptive attempt at the ontology design exercise in Task 5.4.1.

Subsequent versions of this deliverable will address the identification of the respondents who will be canvassed, with the goal of compiling responses from an broad cross-section of people and, thereby, creating an unbiased and representative knowledge base.

The final version will present the results of the exercise --- Rwandan cultural knowledge for polite and respectful interaction --- which will then be used as input to Task 1.2 African Modes of Social Interaction, Task 1.3 Africa-centric Design Patterns,  and Task 5.4.1 Cultural Knowledge Ontology \& Knowledge Base.

%===============================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix I: Cultural Knowledge  Survey Questionnaire }
 
\subsection*{Respectful Interaction}
In daily life, people interact with one another in several ways. They interact verbally using speech and they interact non-verbally using body language, e.g, by gesturing with their hands, arms, shoulders, faces, lips, eyes, and eyebrows.  During such social interaction, they often position their bodies in certain ways.  It is highly desirable that all interaction between people be conducted in a respectful manner by being aware of social and cultural norms and expectations. 

\subsection*{Goal of the Survey}
This survey aims to answer the following two questions: ``How do you behave respectfully  when interacting with people in Rwanda and how should you not behave?''   

\subsection*{Purpose of the Survey}
The knowledge that is gathered in this survey will be used to equip social robots with cultural knowledge that will allow them to interact respectfully and politely with people  using non-verbal,  verbal, and spatial modes of behaviour.

\subsection*{Structure of the Questionnaire}
The questionnaire has three parts. 

In Part 1, we ask you to provide some information about yourself.  This information will be kept in strict confidence and it is only used to check that the survey is balanced in terms of age, gender, cultural heritage, and nationality. 

In Part 2, we will ask you whether  you consider cultural knowledge we have gathered in previous surveys\footnote{We canvassed the views of twenty-three people from eight countries in Africa to  collect this cultural knowledge.} to be correct or not. The focus of these surveys was on human-robot interaction, derived from human-human interaction, and so the social settings reflects situations where one might encounter a social robot, e.g., hospitals, airports, exhibitions, shopping malls, and offices.

In Part 3, we  ask you to answer several questions to help us identify different forms of culturally sensitive, respectful behaviours --- movements, actions, or activities --- and disrespectful behaviours.
