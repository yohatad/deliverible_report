\label{executive_summary}
%%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}
 
Deliverable D1.2  comprises a compendium of population-based cultural knowledge regarding behaviors, activities, actions, and movements that are either culturally sensitive or  insensitive. This knowledge is used to specify the culturally sensitive African modes of social interaction in Deliverable D1.3 and the Africa-centric design patterns in Deliverable D1.4. It will be formalized in the cultural knowledge ontology and knowledge base in Deliverable D5.4.1.  The cultural knowledge has been gathered by developing a detailed questionnaire and using it  to survey a cross-section of Rwandan citizens.
The survey  is available online and a pilot survey has been completed. The Kinyarwanda version is   \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSu95pCT2MsRohukI9ib6GxsuyXuQozeqGQXO9DYcDD5RvlQ/viewform}{here} and the English version is   \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-5lz0YfPCtK5BSL6cGkmlJVkE0vwyKXppkhXs4l1rYPwKlA/viewform}{here}.

\section{Introduction}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:introduction}

This report is a compilation of the culture-specific knowledge that is needed to achieve culturally-sensitive human robot interaction between robots and Rwandan people. The goal is to capture  the subtleties of verbal and non-verbal communication, such as appropriate greeting gestures and eye contact norms in various social contexts.   To acquire this knowledge, we surveyed a representative cross-section of Rwandan citizens, focussing on human-human interaction, rather than human-robot interaction. This approach was adopted to avoid introducing the concept of social robots --- a concept that might not be familiar to all participants in the survey --- when canvassing their views.   The canvassing exercise was conducted  using the questionnaire in Appendix I (English) and Appendix II (Kinyarwanda). The survey is available online. The Kinyarwanda version is available  \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSu95pCT2MsRohukI9ib6GxsuyXuQozeqGQXO9DYcDD5RvlQ/viewform}{here} and the English version is available here \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-5lz0YfPCtK5BSL6cGkmlJVkE0vwyKXppkhXs4l1rYPwKlA/viewform}{here}.\\

\noindent Based on the consensus answers to the questions in the survey, this report   presents a compendium of population-based cultural knowledge regarding behaviours, activities, actions, and movements\footnote{We define a behavior as a pattern of activity, an activity as a sequence of actions, an action as a goal-directed sequence of motions, and a motion as a change in effector pose, subject to constraints, e.g., trajectory or  biological  velocity and acceleration profile.}  that are either culturally sensitive or culturally insensitive, i.e., Rwandan cultural knowledge for polite and respectful interaction. This knowledge provides input to Task 1.3 African Modes of Social Interaction, Task 1.4 Africa-centric Design Patterns,  and, in particular, to Task 5.4.1 Cultural Knowledge Ontology \& Knowledge Base.



\section{Survey Methodology}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:methodology}

The CSSR4Africa project focuses on an ethnographic study of cultural knowledge in Rwanda and South Africa, with the first phase concentrating on a detailed survey of Rwandan culture. The survey follows a systematic process:  developing an initial knowledge ontology to structure the questionnaire, formulating questions to elicit knowledge in each category,  designing and implementing data collection methods and response visualization tools,  conducting the survey,  validating the responses, and extracting consensus perspectives in the responses to each of the questions. This knowledge will be used to construct a  comprehensive cultural knowledge database, as reported in Deliverable D5.4.1.

\subsection{Cultural Knowledge Ontology}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:ontology}
 
The ontology, also  described in Deliverable D5.4.1, comprises  three  parts corresponding to spatial interaction, verbal interaction, and non-verbal interaction. Each part comprises specific elements of cultural norms and behaviors. For example, spatial interaction lincludes distance and positioning, while non-verbal Interaction includes eye contact, facial expressions, and hand movements. Verbal interaction covers aspects like word choice, voice tone, and conversation turn-taking. This  ontology served as a guide for developing the culturally knowledge questionnaire, ensuring all important areas of interaction are covered. By mapping out these cultural elements, the ontology makes sure that important aspects of Rwandan social norms are fully addressed in the data collection. The cultural knowledge base, also described in Deliverable D5.4.1, that will be created from the survey results will be organized using this ontology. This will provide a well-structured and complete resource for future work on culturally appropriate social robots in Rwanda.

\subsection{Questionnaire Development}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:development}

The development of the survey questionnaire followed several steps: surveying the literature, drafting questions, and finalizing the questionnaire based on the cultural knowledge ontology. We reviewed relevant studies on cultural competence in robotics and cross-cultural communication to inform our approach, breaking down our main research objective into sub-objectives focusing on spatial interaction norms, verbal communication patterns, and non-verbal cues in Rwandan culture. The process involved brainstorming sessions, reviews, and validation using a checklist from \cite{Bradburn2004}. The resulting bilingual questionnaire in English and Kinyarwanda comprises three parts: (1) personal information for demographic balance, (2) validation of previously gathered cultural knowledge from a preliminary survey of 23 people from eight African countries \cite{ZantouVernon2023}, and (3) identification of culturally sensitive and disrespectful behaviors. This approach allows us to confirm and refine our understanding of Rwandan cultural norms within the broader context of African cultural knowledge. 


\subsection{Collection Methods and Ethical Considerations}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:ethics}

The study balances effective data collection with ethical research practices. We identified the study population primarily from Kigali city, chosen for relevant characteristics, cost-effectiveness, and logistical support. Participants aged 18-65, speaking English and Kinyarwanda, were selected using purposive sampling. Data collection sites included university campuses, markets, and cafeterias to ensure diverse representation. Throughout this process, ethical considerations were paramount. We obtained informed consent, maintained anonymity and confidentiality, and designed the survey so that it itself is culturally sensitive. A local research team reviewed questions to avoid offensive content, and all necessary university authorization processes were followed during the piloting phase. This approach ensured research integrity while respecting participants' rights and cultural sensitivities, creating a foundation for robust and ethically sound data collection.

\subsection{Structure of the Survey}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:survey}


The survey has three parts. 
Part 1 asks for background demographic information about the respondent. 
Part 2 asks the respondent to answer twenty-seven questions to determine their view on the correctness of  cultural knowledge that was gathered in previous surveys. 
Part 3 asks the respondent to answer thirty questions formulated to identify different forms of culturally sensitive, respectful behaviours --- movements, actions, or activities --- and disrespectful behaviours.
Concise versions of the questions in Parts 2 and 3 of the survey are shown for convenience in Tables \ref{table:questions2}  and   \ref{table:questions3}. The full survey is detailed in Appendix I and Appendix II.


\subsection{Pilot Survey}
%===============================================================


Before lauching the survey of the general public in Rwanda, it was piloted at Carnegie Mellon University Africa (CMU-Africa) over a two-month period. CMU-Africa was chosen as the pilot site due to the ongoing nature of the project there and the streamlined process for obtaining legal permission to collect data. We collected 108 responses in English and 35 in Kinyarwanda. This sample size provides valuable insights for refining our survey methodology. The pilot helped us improve the questionnaire, particularly in clarifying cultural terminology and adjusting question sequencing. Notably, we received no negative comments about the questionnaire design, indicating that participants found the questions clear and well-constructed. Moving forward, we will use these pilot results to finalize our questionnaire and sampling strategy for the main data collection phase, ensuring a robust and culturally sensitive research instrument.

\subsection{Demographics}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:demographics}

\vspace{-5mm}
\caption{Graphic depiction of the demographics of the 143 respondents who took the pilot survey}
\label{fig:demographics}       
\end{figure}

Of the 143 respondents, 78 were male, and 47 were female. This is a more balanced gender distribution than the population from which the respondents were drawn. \\

\noindent In terms of age, the majority of participants were in the 20‚Äì29 age group, followed by a smaller number in the 30‚Äì39 range. Very few respondents were aged 40‚Äì49, 50‚Äì59, or 60 and older. Despite this, the data collected represents a range of demographic groups, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:demographics}.

\subsection{Data Analysis Techniques}
%===============================================================
\label{section:data_analysis}

Significant effort was expended in performing  comprehensive data analysis to build the cultural knowledge base. This involved cleaning and organizing the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency, and then identifying prevalent consensus answers to each question. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were employed to identify key cultural elements and patterns within the responses.

\vspace{-5mm}
\caption{A summary of the responses for Question 3-3 How should you pass a group of two or more people?}
\label{fig:consensus2}       
\end{figure}

\noindent The data cleaning phase was carried out in two stages, an initial scan by three members of the team to identify questions for the answers were clearly equivocal, and a workshop involving ten members of the team to identify consensus answers.  In the first stage, two questions were identified --- 3.28 and 3-30 --- and they were excluded from further consideration.  In the second stage, the answers to each question were displayed and the workshop participants voted to decided on the consensus answer, if one existed.  To visualize survey responses, a dashboard was developed using Dash, a Python web framework built on Plotly that specializes in creating interactive data visualization applications. This dashboard displays all survey questions and allows users to interact with the data using a slider bar to select the question and responses for analysis. The data is presented using bar charts and tables, as illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:dashboard1} and \ref{fig:dashboard2}. This visualization framework improved accessibility and simplified the analysis of survey results. Examples of the histogram of answers to two questions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:consensus1} and \ref{fig:consensus2}.   No consensus was found for three questions ---  2-4, 2-5, and 2-8  --- and these were also excluded from futher consideration.\\

\noindent The results of this  analysis, described in Section \ref{section:knowledge},  forms the foundation for  a detailed cultural knowledge base, which will be used to guide the behavior of a Pepper social robot.

\section{Survey Results: Rwandan Cultural Knowledge for Respectful Interaction}
%===============================================================
\label{section:knowledge}


Tables \ref{table:AllAnswers2}  and \ref{table:AllAnswers3} presents the consensus answers to the subset of fifty-seven questions in the cultural knowledge survey questionnaire in Appendices I and II, after having removed the questions for which no consensus could be identified. These capture the behaviors, activities, actions, and motions that are considered polite and respectful when interacting with people in Rwanda.\\~\\

\section{Conclusion}
%===============================================================
 \label{section:conclusion}

This study represents an esential  step in developing culturally sensitive social robotics for Rwanda and South Africa. The CSSR4Africa project has successfully piloted a survey at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, gathering 143 responses   that provide valuable insights into Rwandan cultural norms. The next phase involves expanding data collection in Rwanda and initiating similar studies in South Africa. Detailed analysis of the results will lead to the development of a comprehensive cultural knowledge database, which will inform the creation of a detailed cultural knowledge ontology. This ontology will ensure that social robots align with local norms. By incorporating these cultural insights, the CSSR4Africa project aims to enhance the acceptance and effectiveness of social robots in Rwanda and South Africa, promoting their successful integration in diverse African settings.

%===============================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix I: Cultural Knowledge  Survey Questionnaire  (English) }
 
\subsection*{Respectful Interaction}
In daily life, people interact with one another in several ways. They interact verbally using speech and they interact non-verbally using body language, e.g, by gesturing with their hands, arms, shoulders, faces, lips, eyes, and eyebrows.  During such social interaction, they often position their bodies in certain ways.  It is highly desirable that all interaction between people be conducted in a respectful manner by being aware of social and cultural norms and expectations. 

\subsection*{Goal of the Survey}
This survey aims to answer the following two questions: ``How do you behave respectfully  when interacting with people in Rwanda and how should you not behave?''   

\subsection*{Purpose of the Survey}
The knowledge that is gathered in this survey will be used to equip social robots with cultural knowledge that will allow them to interact respectfully and politely with people  using non-verbal,  verbal, and spatial modes of behaviour.

\subsection*{Structure of the Questionnaire}
The questionnaire has three parts. 

In Part 1, we ask you to provide some information about yourself.  This information will be kept in strict confidence and it is only used to check that the survey is balanced in terms of age, gender, cultural heritage, and nationality. 

In Part 2, we will ask you whether  you consider cultural knowledge we have gathered in previous surveys\footnote{We canvassed the views of twenty-three people from eight countries in Africa to  collect this cultural knowledge.} to be correct or not. The focus of these surveys was on human-robot interaction, derived from human-human interaction, and so the social settings reflects situations where one might encounter a social robot, e.g., hospitals, airports, exhibitions, shopping malls, and offices.

In Part 3, we  ask you to answer several questions to help us identify different forms of culturally sensitive, respectful behaviours --- movements, actions, or activities --- and disrespectful behaviours.

\section*{Appendix III: Dashboard for Cultural Knowledge Survey Questionnaire Responses}
\label{section: appendixiii}
%================================================================
The CSSR4Africa Questionnaire Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to visualize qualitative survey responses collected as part of the Rwandan Cultural Knowledge Survey. Developed using Plotly Dash in Python, the dashboard enables users to dynamically explore survey results through interactive visualizations. This section provides an overview of the dashboard's structure, functionality, and implementation details.\\
The Figure \ref{fig:dashboard3} provides a visual representation of the multiple-choice question type in the dashboard layout.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dashboard3.png} 
    \caption{CSSR4Africa Cultural Knowledge Survey Dashboard. The image illustrates the main sections: (1) Header Section, (2) Slider Section, (3) Bar Chart, and (4) Logo.}
    \label{fig:dashboard3}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(1) Header Section:} This section includes the title \textit{Culturally Sensitive Social Robotics for Africa}, the CSSR4Africa logo, and the location \textit{Kigali, Rwanda}. It serves as an introduction to the survey and its objectives.
    
    \item \textbf{(2) Slider Section:} Positioned below the header, the slider allows users to navigate through different survey questions, numbered from 0 to 57. Users can select a question, and the results update dynamically based on their selection. To move through all the questions, users can click on a specific question number on the slider or, after selecting the first question, use the keyboard arrow keys, a mouse, or a slide remote.
    
    \item \textbf{(3) Bar Chart:} This section presents the data visualization corresponding to the selected multiple-choice questions. The results are displayed using a bar graph, where the x-axis represents the different multiple-choice options available for the selected question, and the y-axis shows the count of responses for each choice. Based on these results, the option with the highest number of responses is chosen as the final conclusion for the survey question.
    
    \item \textbf{(4) Logo:} This section remains inactive since only multiple-choice questions without text have short answers.
\end{itemize}
%================================================================
The Figure \ref{fig:dashboard4} provides a visual representation of a multiple-choice question type that includes an ``Other" option, allowing respondents to specify their own answers in the dashboard layout.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dashboard44.png} 
    \caption{CSSR4Africa Cultural Knowledge Survey Dashboard. The image illustrates the main sections: (1) Sample selected question using the slider, (2) Bar chart, and (3) Table displaying responses for the "Other" option.}
    \label{fig:dashboard4}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(1) Sample Selected Question:} This section represents a sample selected question that includes "Other" as a multiple-choice answer option.
    
    \item \textbf{(2) Bar Chart Visualization:} The bar chart visualization is similar to the one explained previously in Figure \ref{fig:dashboard3}.
    
    \item \textbf{(3) Table Display for "Other" Responses:} For respondents who select "Other" and provide their own answers, their responses are displayed in a table format, as shown in this section.
\end{itemize}
%================================================================
\newpage
\noindent The Figure \ref{fig:dashboard5} provides a visual representation of a multiple-choice question with a "Yes" or "No" option. If "Yes" is selected, respondents are allowed to specify their own answers, which are then displayed as tables in the dashboard layout.

    \label{fig:dashboard5}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(1) Selected Question:} This section represents a randomly selected question that requires short answers, specifically requesting the gesture used for a particular type of behavior.
    
    \item \textbf{(2) Multiple-Choice Responses:} This section displays the responses for the multiple-choice question, illustrating whether gestures are used or not for the specified behavior.
    
    \item \textbf{(3) Gesture Specification Table:} If "Yes" is selected, respondents specify the gesture used, which is then displayed in the dashboard as a table.
    
    \item \textbf{(4) Annotated Gesture Table:} Before this table is generated, the table in section (3) is annotated to group similar gestures that were responded to using different phrases or expressions but belong to the same category. This section then organizes the gestures and displays the gesture names along with their corresponding percentage in the collected data.
    
    \item \textbf{(5) Conclusion Answer:} Based on the percentage shown in table (4), the final conclusion for the selected question is determined.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{File Structure}
The \texttt{dashboard} directory is organized to include data files, asset files, source code, a \texttt{README.md} file, requirements, and configuration files. The \texttt{config} folder contains essential configuration files, including \texttt{dashboard\_configuration.ini}, which uses key-value pairs to specify the data source‚Äîeither an Excel file or a Google Spreadsheet. The \texttt{data} directory contains all survey-related datasets, such as \texttt{cssr-406009-380cb664c48a.json}, which serves as Google Sheets credentials for accessing survey data, and \texttt{Cultural Knowledge Survey.xlsx}, the primary Excel file containing survey responses. Additionally, the folder includes multiple CSV files categorized into hand, face, and body movement data. 
\\~\\
These files follow the naming format \texttt{<name>\_sdf\_<body|hand|face>\_<question number>} and represent the annotated versions of responses. These annotations help draw conclusions from short-answer questions, specifically from \texttt{Questions 47 to 57}, on the dashboard. 
\\~\\
The \texttt{src} folder contains the \texttt{assets} folder, which includes \texttt{dashboard\_style.css}, a stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the dashboard, including layout, typography, tables, buttons, and interactive elements. Additionally, the folder includes \texttt{dashboard\_application.py}, which implements the Dash web application for visualizing survey responses with interactive features such as a question selection slider, bar chart visualizations, a dynamic data table, and an extra section that appears based on specific questions. The \texttt{dashboard\_implementation.py} script processes survey responses and updates visualizations dynamically. The \texttt{dashboard\_data\_processing.py} script loads and processes survey data from Google Sheets or an Excel file, filters Rwandan participants, categorizes survey questions, and prepares data for visualization. 
\\~\\
Lastly, \texttt{dashboard\_questions\_data.py} stores multiple-choice survey questions in a structured dictionary format, where each question is a key and answer choices are stored under "options", allowing for efficient bar graph generation and response categorization. Additionally, the \texttt{dashboard\_requirements.txt} file lists the dependencies required for running the application, and the \texttt{README.md} provides documentation on how to install, configure, and execute the dashboard. A detailed representation of the directory structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dashboard-dir}.

%==============================================================
\subsection*{Executing the Dashboard}
To run the dashboard, first determine the data source: Google Sheets or an Excel file. During the active survey phase, Google Sheets was used to monitor real-time responses, as it dynamically updates when new data is received from the linked Google Form. Once survey collection is complete, the Google Sheet can be downloaded as an Excel file for further analysis in the dashboard. The dashboard supports both versions, and we can use the one that best suits the condition.

\subsubsection*{Getting Google Credentials (JSON File)}
Go to \href{https://console.cloud.google.com/}{Google Cloud Console} and sign in with your Google account. Create or select a project by clicking \href{https://console.cloud.google.com/}{Select a Project}, then enable the Google Sheets API via APIs \& \textbf{Services > Library}, search for Google Sheets API, and click\textbf{ Enable}; create credentials under APIs \& \textbf{Services > Credentials}, select Service Account, fill in details, assign at least Editor or Owner role, and click \textbf{Done}; generate and download the JSON key by navigating to the Keys tab, clicking \textbf{Add Key > Create New Key, choosing JSON}, and storing the file securely as credentials.json.
