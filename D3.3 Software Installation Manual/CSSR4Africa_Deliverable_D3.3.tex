\section{Introduction}
Software Installation Manual(D3.3) outlines the detailed steps necessary for installing and executing the software critical for deploying parts or the entirety of the CSSR4Africa system, as well as conducting the requisite unit, integration, and system tests. It is designed for systems running a native Ubuntu 20.04 OS and equipped with ROS Noetic. The manual also specifies the NAOqi OS version for the robot as 2.5.10.7.

The manual is divided into several key sections. The initial section, referred to as ``Setting up Pepper Robot, delineates the preliminary configurations required for the Pepper robot before any software installations. Following this, the ``Setting up the Development Environment" section provides comprehensive instructions for preparing the development environments tailored for both the physical robot and the Gazebo simulator. This includes a walkthrough of the prerequisite setup common to both environments, followed by specific installation procedures. Lastly, the ``Installing and Running the CSSR4Africa Software" section discusses installing and initiating the CSSR4Africa software, ensuring a smooth deployment.

\section{Setting up Pepper robot}
{\label{setup_pepper}
To configure the Pepper robot for the first time, reference the Pepper Robot Pocket Guide included with your robot when shipped. This guide provides detailed instructions for unboxing and setting up your robot. For additional support, access the online configuration guide at \href{http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_user_guide/first_conf_pep.html}{Pepper User Guide}. We are utilizing version 1.8 of the Pepper robot. For comprehensive technical details, including its sensor and actuator capabilities, please refer to the 
\href{http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/index_pep.html}{Pepper Technical Detail} \cite{SoftBankDocumentation}. This resource offers a thorough overview of the robot's technical specifications

Next, establish a Wi-Fi connection between the robot and the user's computer. It's advisable to use a dedicated Wi-Fi router for this purpose, rather than relying on a campus wireless network (CMU), to avoid the complications of logging in with a school ID (Andrew ID). To achieve this, connect a router to the campus's network via an Ethernet cable. Upon powering your laptop, instructions on the tablet will guide you to connect to this router. Once connected, the Pepper robot will vocalize its IP address when you press the power button once. This IP address is crucial, as it will be used to establish a connection through ROS (Robot Operating System), enabling communication and control of the robot from your computer. Furthermore, we set up the router for the robot to have a static IP address using the robot's MAC address. 

The MAC address can be found when accessing the Pepper web page as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pepper-web-page} by opening a web browser and entering the IP address. Then log in by setting the username and password you configured when setting up the robot. Then using the Wi-Fi MAC address configure the router to have the pepper robot IP address permanent. This can be done by looking in the DHCP or static IP Assignment. Then assign a static IP address by adding a new reservation, enter the MAC  address, and save the setting. Restart the robot and the router for the changes to take effect.

\section{Setting up the Development Environment}
{
\label{devenv}
This section provides step-by-step instructions for installing a set of software packages required to control the physical Pepper robot and the robot in the Gazebo simulator. Open a new terminal \textit{\textbf{(ctrl + shift + t)}} and type the following commands carefully. 

\paragraph{Prerequisite}

{The user needs to have Ubuntu 20.04 running natively for all the software to work properly.}

}

\subsection{Method 1: Shell Script Installation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the directory.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/cssr4africa/software-Installation-scripts.git
\end{lstlisting} 
\item Make the all the shell files in the Software Installation Scripts executable
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
chmod +x $HOME/workspace/software-Installation-scripts/*.sh
\end{lstlisting}
\item Run the shell script for installing ROS-Noetic.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
./install_ros_noetic.sh
\end{lstlisting}
\item Run the shell script for installing the necessary packages and setting up the workspace
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
./install_pepper_ws.sh
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
\hspace{0.9cm}

\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
}
\subsubsection{Setting up the Development Environment for the Physical Robot}
\label{phyrob}
\subsubsection*{Installing NAOqi Driver and ROS Packages}

The NAOqi driver is a module that provides bridge capabilities. It publishes sensory data and the pepper position, enabling ROS to call part of the NAOqi API. The driver is dependent on \texttt{naoqi\_libqi, naoqi\_libqicore,} and \texttt{naoqi\_bridge\_msgs} packages. Those packages could be installed using apt-get. The rest of the packages are installed from the source by cloning them from GitHub. The three packages \texttt{naoqi\_dcm\_driver}, \texttt{naoqi\_driver}, and \texttt{pepper\_dcm\_robot} have been modified compared to the official repository on GitHub. Hence, these updated packages are under the CSSR4Africa repository.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
# Install the NAOqi driver
sudo apt-get install ros-.*-naoqi-driver
        
# Create ROS workspace
mkdir -p $HOME/workspace/pepper_rob_ws/src
        
# Move to the workspace directory
cd $HOME/workspace/pepper_rob_ws/src
    
# Clone NAOqi DCM driver repository
git clone https://github.com/cssr4africa/naoqi_dcm_driver.git

# Clone NAOqi driver repository
git clone https://github.com/cssr4africa/naoqi_driver.git
    
# Clone Pepper DCM driver repository
git clone https://github.com/cssr4africa/pepper_dcm_robot.git

# Clone Pepper virtual repository
git clone https://github.com/ros-naoqi/pepper_virtual.git

# Clone Pepper robot repository
git clone https://github.com/ros-naoqi/pepper_robot.git
    
# Clone Pepper moveit config repository
git clone https://github.com/ros-naoqi/pepper_moveit_config.git

# Make scripts in naoqi_driver package executable
chmod +x $HOME/workspace/pepper_rob_ws/src/naoqi_driver/scripts/*
    
# Build the repository
cd .. && catkin_make
# Add the workspace to your ROS environment by sourcing the setup file in devel folder
source devel/setup.bash

# Add the setup to your .bashrc file so that you don't have to do this every time you open a new terminal
echo "source $HOME/workspace/pepper_rob_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> \
$HOME/.bashrc

# Install additional packages
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-joint-trajectory-controller
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-controllers
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-pepper-meshes
       
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{Installing and Configuring the Python NAOqi SDK}
{
The NAOqi Framework, a cross-language programming framework for programming Pepper, supports both C++ and Python. The Python NAOqi SDK was used when the microphone sensor failed to function with the naoqi\_driver, the Python SDK was employed to access the microphone sensors' API. This method allowed the modified naoqi\_driver to publish the captured audio data successfully. Furthermore, since the tablet was not supported by the ROS-NAOqi drivers, the Python SDK was used to provide an interface through ROS. 

rospy (a python client library for ROS(Robot Operating System) which enables the development of ROS-based applications was used mainly to define publishers, subscribers, and services. However, one of the limitations of 
Python SDK is that it runs on Python 2 whereas rospy uses Python 3 (ROS-Noetic). To overcome this problem, a UDP socket was used that will send the data from Python 2 to the python3 script that receives data and then publishes or provides a ros service using the rospy.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change directory to home  
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
cd $HOME
\end{lstlisting}

\item Installing Python 2.7 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
sudo apt install python2

# check the version of the Python
python2 --version
\end{lstlisting}

\item Installing Pip2 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
\end{lstlisting}

\item Installing the necessary packages

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
sudo apt-get install libpython2.7
sudo apt-get install libatlas3-base 
sudo python2 get-pip.py
\end{lstlisting}

\item Checking the pip2 version
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
pip2 --version
\end{lstlisting}

\item Installing NumPy
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
pip2 install numpy
\end{lstlisting}

\item Download the Python SDK by using the following command. 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
wget -S -L https://community-static.aldebaran.com/resources/2.5.5/\
sdk-python/pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.5.5-linux64.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

\item Extract the SDK
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
tar -xvf pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.5.5-linux64.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

\item To ensure that the \texttt{PYTHONPATH} environment variable is automatically set every time a new shell session starts. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash, escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}]
# If you extracted it in another directory you can set it up by putting the correct path here. 

(*@\color{red}{In addition, Write the entire code in one line (avoid using two}@*)
(*@\color{red}{lines)}@*)

echo "export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$HOME/pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.5.5-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages" >> $HOME/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}


To apply the changes immediately, you can source your 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
source $HOME/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
}
\subsubsection*{Bring up Pepper}
{
\label{bup}
To establish communication between the computer device and the Pepper robot, the IP address of the computer device, its network interface name, and the IP address of the Pepper robot are needed. Below are the steps to find this information. First, ensure the Pepper robot and computer device are on the same network.\\

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{IP address identification of the computer}
{
\label{ipsystem}
To find the IP address of the computer device, open a new terminal and execute \texttt{ifconfig} commands.

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{images/Ifconfig.png}
\caption{\texttt{ifconfig} command output: Network interface name and IP address.}
\label{fig:ifconfig}
\end{figure}

Upon executing the \texttt{ifconfig} command, the output will display information similar to the illustration shown in Figure \ref{fig:ifconfig}. Please take note of the network interface name and its corresponding IP address as shown in the output. This IP address will be passed as a value for the \texttt{roscore\_ip} argument. Similarly, the network interface must be passed as a value for the \texttt{network\_interface} argument.} 
    
\item \textbf{IP address identification of the Pepper robot}
To find the IP address of the Pepper Robot, ensure the robot is powered on and connected to the network. Usually when the Pepper Robot is booting it says, ``Hello, I'm Pepper, my internet address is $<robot\_ip >$ (for example, 172.29.111.230)". If you missed it, press the chest button once and take note of that IP address. This IP address will be passed as a value for the robot\_ip argument.

\end{enumerate}
\noindent Using the above IP address of the robot, the IP address, and the network interface name of the computer device, the following instruction will bring Pepper up over ROS, and the NAOqi driver will be launched. Below are the instructions to follow for the sample shown above:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a new terminal and bring up the Pepper robot (assuming the robot is turned on).
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
roslaunch pepper_dcm_bringup pepper_bringup.launch \
robot_ip:=172.29.111.230 roscore_ip:=172.29.111.229 \
network_interface:=ens160
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage

\item Open a new terminal and launch the NAOqi driver.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
roslaunch naoqi_driver naoqi_driver.launch nao_ip:=172.29.111.230 \
roscore_ip:=172.29.111.229 network_interface:=ens160
\end{lstlisting} 
\end{enumerate}
}

\subsubsection{Setting up the Development Environment for the Gazebo Simulator}
\label{simulator}
Section \ref{phyrob} assumes access to a physical Pepper robot. However, circumstances may arise where testing software without the physical robot becomes necessary. In such cases, a simulator can serve as an alternative. This section explains how to control the Pepper robot within a Gazebo simulator. The simulation is based on an open-source Pepper ROS environment developed by Sam Pfeiffer.\footnote{The Pepper ROS simulator is available on the following links: \url{https://github.com/awesomebytes/pepper\_virtual}} The installation of the Gazebo simulator is presented below.

\subsubsection*{Installation of the Gazebo Simulator}
To set up the Gazebo simulator for the Pepper robot, follow the instructions below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Setup Pepper in the Gazebo Simulator}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a separate workspace for the simulator installation.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
mkdir -p $HOME/workspace/pepper_sim_ws/src
cd $HOME/workspace/pepper_sim_ws/src
\end{lstlisting} 

    \item Clone the necessary packages from the GitHub repository.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
git clone -b correct_chain_model_and_gazebo_enabled \
https://github.com/awesomebytes/pepper_robot
\end{lstlisting} 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
git clone -b simulation_that_works \
https://github.com/awesomebytes/pepper_virtual
\end{lstlisting} 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/cssr4africa/\gazebo_model_velocity_plugin
\end{lstlisting} 

\item Install additional libraries.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-sensor-msgs \
ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers \
ros-noetic-gazebo-ros ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control \
ros-noetic-gazebo-plugins ros-noetic-controller-manager \
ros-noetic-ddynamic-reconfigure-python
\end{lstlisting}

\item Install pepper mesh.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-pepper-meshes
\end{lstlisting}

\item Build the packages in the workspace.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
cd .. && catkin_make -DSIMULATOR=ON
\end{lstlisting}

After setting up the physical robot's environment, follow step f to modify the \texttt{.bashrc} will result in the simulator environment being sourced last, overriding the physical robot's settings. If your main work is with the physical robot, consider skipping this step. You can manually \texttt{source devel/setup.bash} when necessary for simulator tasks to maintain the correct environment setup 
\end{tcolorbox}
\endgroup


\item Make ROS environment variables automatically added every time a new shell is launched.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
echo "source $HOME/workspace/pepper_sim_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> \
$HOME/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
source $HOME/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Run the Pepper Gazebo Simulator}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start the Gazebo simulation.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
roslaunch pepper_gazebo_plugin \
pepper_gazebo_plugin_in_office_CPU.launch
\end{lstlisting}

\label{fig:gazebo-sim}
\end{figure}
Once you've successfully launched the simulator, your simulation environment should be similar to Figure \ref{fig:gazebo-sim}.
To visualize the simulation on rviz, open a new terminal and type the below command.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find \
pepper_gazebo_plugin`/config/pepper_sensors.rviz
\end{lstlisting}

}}
\caption{Directory structure for the \texttt{pepper\_interface\_tests} package. There are two nodes: \texttt{actuatorTest} and \texttt{sensorTest}.}
\end{figure}

The actuator test includes testing the head, hand, arm, leg, and wheels. The sensor test comprehensively assesses multiple sensors: front and back sonar, front and bottom cameras, stereo and depth cameras, laser sensor, microphone, odometry, and joint states.

\noindent To run the test on the physical robot, change the first line of the actuatorTestConfiguration.ini and sensorTestConfiguration.ini file to \texttt{platform robot}. On the other hand, to run the test on the simulator platform, change the first line of the actuatorTestConfiguration.ini and sensorTestConfiguration.ini file to \texttt{platform simulator}. 

\noindent Before starting the test on the physical robot, run the launch file of the \texttt{pepper\_interface\_tests} package either the actuatorTestLaunchRobot.launch or sensorTestLaunchRobot.launch. Please replace the variables \texttt{robot\_ip, roscore\_ip,} and \texttt{network\_interface\_name} with the values obtained from the section \ref{bup}. Then proceed to run the actuator and sensor test.\\

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
cd $HOME/workspace/pepper_rob_ws
source devel/setup.bash
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Before starting the test on the robot, open a new terminal and launch either the sensor launch file or the actuator launch file.\\

The launch file can be updated to incorporate default values for each parameter, simplifying the initiation process for the physical robot. To achieve this, navigate to either the \texttt{sensorTestLaunchRobot.launch} or \texttt{actuatorTestLaunchRobot.launch} file and modify the default parameter values to reflect those currently used.
\end{tcolorbox}
\endgroup

\vspace{1.0em}

If you are running the test for the simulator, start by sourcing the simulator workspace 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
cd $HOME/workspace/pepper_sim_ws
source devel/setup.bash
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
roslaunch pepper_interface_tests interfaceTestLaunchSimulator.launch
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent To begin the tests open a new terminal and run the following node.
\begin{enumerate}
    
\item Test the sensors
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
rosrun pepper_interface_tests sensorTest
\end{lstlisting}
During each sensor test, the sensor's numerical output data will be logged to a ``sensorTestOutput.dat" file. Additionally, real-time sensor values will be displayed in the terminal for a 10-second. Meanwhile, sensor data images will be showcased in a separate window for a 10-second interval.\\

Please go through deliverables to \href{https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D4.1.pdf}
{Deliverable D4.1} for a detailed report for the sensor Test task.

\item Test the actuator
\begin{lstlisting}[style=withoutNumbering, language=bash]
rosrun pepper_interface_tests actuatorTest
\end{lstlisting}
    
The acutator test is designed to unit test each joint by moving the joint to its minimum, maximum, and mid-range position at a selected angular velocity. The progress for testing each joint will be displayed in the terminal. 

Please go through deliverables to \href{https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D5.1.pdf}
{Deliverable 5.1} for a detailed report for the actuator Test task.
