@article{Jacqueyetal2019,
	abstract = {Much current work in robotics focuses on the development of robots capable of autonomous unsupervised learning. An essential prerequisite for such learning to be possible is that the agent should be sensitive to the link between its actions and the consequences of its actions, called sensorimotor contingencies. This sensitivity, and more particularly its role as a key drive of development, has been widely studied by developmental psychologists. However, the results of these studies may not necessarily be accessible or intelligible to roboticians. In this paper, we review the main experimental data demonstrating the role of sensitivity to sensorimotor contingencies in infants' acquisition of four fundamental motor and cognitive abilities: body knowledge, memory, generalization, and goal-directedness. We relate this data from developmental psychology to work in robotics, highlighting the links between these two domains of research. In the last part of the article we present a blueprint architecture demonstrating how exploitation of sensitivity to sensorimotor contingencies, combined with the notion of ``goal''' allows an agent to develop new sensorimotor skills. This architecture can be used to guide the design of specific computational models, and also to possibly envisage new empirical experiments.},

@inproceedings{Yaoetal18,
	abstract = {It is always well believed that modeling relationships between objects would be helpful for representing and eventually describing an image. Nevertheless, there has not been evidence in support of the idea on image description generation. In this paper, we introduce a new design to explore the connections between objects for image captioning under the umbrella of attention-based encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, we present Graph Convolutional Networks plus Long Short-Term Memory (dubbed as GCN-LSTM) architecture that novelly integrates both semantic and spatial object relationships into image encoder. Technically, we build graphs over the detected objects in an image based on their spatial and semantic connections. The representations of each region proposed on objects are then refined by leveraging graph structure through GCN. With the learnt region-level features, our GCN-LSTM capitalizes on LSTM-based captioning framework with attention mechanism for sentence generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, GCN-LSTM increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1{\%} to 128.7{\%} on COCO testing set.},

	abstract = {The algorithmic generation of textual descriptions of image sequences requires conceptual knowledge. In our case, a stationary camera recorded image sequences of road tra$\pm$c scenes. The necessary conceptual knowledge has been provided in the form of a so-called Situation Graph Tree (SGT). Other endeavors such as the generation of a synthetic image sequence from a textual description or the transformation of machine vision results for use in a driver assistance system could profit from the exploitation of the same conceptual knowledge, but more in a planning (pre-scriptive) rather than a de-scriptive context. A recently discussed planning formalism, Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs), exhibits a number of formal similarities with SGTs. These suggest to investigate whether and to which extent SGTs may be re-cast as HTNs in order to re-use the conceptual knowledge about the behavior of vehicles in road tra$\pm$c scenes for planning purposes.},

	abstract = {We are interested in methods for building more intelligent cognitive vision systems in our ActIPret project. The aim of this project is understanding the activities of expert operators for teaching and education. Our approach is to learn models for the components and later the task and context of the visual processing in the ActIPret system. The paper first introduces general issues and some approaches for the example of gesture learning and recognition. Second, aspects of our cognitive vision framework are described as they are relevant to the evaluation of the two approaches tested here. Third, the computational models for the time delay RBF (TDRBF) network and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are described and results given. Finally, extensions of this work and conclusions for system integration of the results are discussed in the light of task-based control and contextual processing.},

Such an instantiated conceptual representation will in turn provide the input for a text generation subsystem. This contribution outlines a system implementation which relies on a fuzzy metric-temporal (Horn) logic to realize the systeminternal generic representation. The instantiation step is realized as the search for a suitable interpretation of the corresponding set of logic formulae where the geometric results obtained by image sequence evaluation provide the set of individuals. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by abstraction processes which aggregate suitably selected vehicles from recorded road traffic scenes into a vehicle queue.},
